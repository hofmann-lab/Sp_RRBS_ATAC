# Sp_RRBS_ATAC
This repository contains all code and data used by Sam Bogan, Marie Strader, and Gretchen Hofmann for analyzing the effect of differential methylation on expression and splicing in the purple urchin during transgenerational plasticity. Analyses also include multifactorial models of transcription as a function of methylation and chromatin state (i.e., ATAC-seq data).
