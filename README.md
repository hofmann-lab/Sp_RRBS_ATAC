# Sp_RRBS_ATAC
This repository is work in process, and will contain all code and data used by Sam Bogan, Marie Strader, and Gretchen Hofmann for analyzing the effect of differential methylation on expression and splicing in the purple urchin during transgenerational plasticity. Analyses also include multifactorial models of transcription as a function of methylation and chromatin state (i.e., ATAC-seq data).

In the table of contents below, each lettered entry represents a folder in this repo with an R markdown file, its knitted report, and the data that it imports.

Table of Contents:
A. Estimations of differential expression, differential splicing, and differential methylation.
        
        1. Presently, the repo contains a matrix of RNA-seq read counts and an R markdown (edgeR_DE_Sp_RRBS_ATAC) for modeling and reporting differential expression            of these reads.
